#Loop through the index numbers

# You can also loop through the tuple items by referring to their index numbers.

#use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.

# print all items by referring to their index numbers :

thistuple = ("apple","banana","cherry")
for i in range(len(thistuple)):    #0,3
    print(thistuple[i])
