#Slicing Strings

#You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.

#Specify the start index and the end index,
# separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.


#Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included)?

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])
print(b[3:6])
print(b[7:10])

# The first character has index 0.
