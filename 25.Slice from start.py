# Slice from the start

#By leaving out the start index,
# the range will start at the first character:

#Get the characters from the start to position 5 (not included)?

b = "Hello, world!"

#Slice to the end

#By leaving out the index, the range will go to the end:

#Get the characters from  position 2, and all the way to the end?

b = "Hello, World!"
