#Access Tuple Items

#You can access tuple items by referring to the index number,
#inside square brackets?


#Print the second item in the tuple ?


thistuple = ("apple","banana","cherry")
print(thistuple[1])


#Negative indexing
#Negative indexing means start from the end.

# -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.


#print the last item of the tuple?

thistuple = ("apple","banana","cherry")
print(thistuple[-1])
